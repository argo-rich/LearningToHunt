TO DEPLOY THIS TO THE EC2 INSTANCE MANUALLY:

1. Publish the files to the "LearningToHunt\publish" folder:  
a. Open Powershell from the project directory (E:\Documents\Code\source\repos\dotnet\LearningToHunt\LearningToHunt)
b. Run the dotnet publish command:
	dotnet publish -o publish --os linux

2. SCP the published files to the EC2 instance using one of the following commands:
	COPY EVERYTHING:
	scp -rp -i "..\..\..\LearningToHunt.com Web App Key.pem" .\publish\* ec2-user@ec2-3-92-55-184.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/learning-to-hunt

	COPY JUST CODE CHANGES (.cs or .cshtml (change "LearningToHunt*" to copy specific file(s))):
	scp -i "..\..\..\LearningToHunt.com Web App Key.pem" .\publish\LearningToHunt* ec2-user@ec2-3-92-55-184.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/learning-to-hunt

TO RUN THE WEBAPP IN EC2:

1. Use Putty to SSH to the EC2 instance by loading the "LearningToHunt" saved session.
   (This uses the "LearningToHunt.com Web App Key.ppk" to SSH to ec2-3-92-55-184.compute-1.amazonaws.com)
2. Run the following command (logs in /home/ec2-user/learning-to-hunt/logs):	
	/home/ec2-user/scripts/stop-learning-to-hunt.sh
	/home/ec2-user/scripts/start-learning-to-hunt.sh
