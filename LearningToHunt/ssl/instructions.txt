TO SET UP SSL CERT USING CERTBOT IN 3 STEPS:

1) Ensure DNS is pointing to the web server.  (You may need to disable SSL/HTTPS first.)

2) Run the certbot command:
$ sudo ./certbot certonly --standalone
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log

Could not bind TCP port 80 because it is already in use by another process on
this system (such as a web server). Please stop the program in question and then
try again.

This certificate expires on 2025-05-04.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

NEXT STEPS:
- The certificate will need to be renewed before it expires. Certbot can automatically renew the 
certificate in the background, but you may need to take steps to enable that functionality. See 
https://certbot.org/renewal-setup for instructions.

3) Convert the cert to PFX so dotnet can use it:
sudo openssl pkcs12 -export -out /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.learningtohunt.com/fullchain.pfx -inkey /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.learningtohunt.com/privkey.pem -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.learningtohunt.com/fullchain.pem
